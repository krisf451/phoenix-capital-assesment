## Usage

As an authenticated user I have full CRUD access to Owners and Land Holdings. As a user if I delete any particular Owner, all of their associated Land Holdings will also be deleted from the database. As a user if I update an Owners name, which is how Owners are associated to Land Holdings, all the related Land Holdigns Owners will also be updated.
